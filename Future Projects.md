# Cauldron

## High-Level summary

Cauldron is a Stream Mini-Game for Viewers, where they trigger fun interactions by cooking magic potions. This is done by allowing them to spend channel points to throw ingredients into a magic cauldron and then turning up the heat to check the combination. If they found a combination that is valid, its effect is triggered, if not, a fun failure animation is displayed.


## Features necessary for an MVP

* Visualization of throwing ingredients into a cauldron
* Reading Twitch PubSub API to get ingredient and turning up the heat redemptions
    * Mapping freeform text in ingredient list to cauldron input
* Orchestration that stores the ingredients in the cauldrons between redemptions
* A set of hardcoded combinations and events they cause
    * 5 should be enough for validation of the concept
